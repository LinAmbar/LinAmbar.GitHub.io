                        Hainanese chicken rice is a dish adapted from early Chinese immigrants originally from Hainan province in southern China. It is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore. Hainanese chicken rice is most commonly associated with Singaporean, Malaysian and Hainanese cuisines, although it is also popular in Thailand, where it's known as Khao Man Gai, Vietnam and Indonesia. It is based on a well-known Hainanese dish called Wenchang chicken (文昌雞), due to its adoption by the Hainanese overseas Chinese population in the Nanyang area (present-day Southeast Asia). Catherine Ling of CNN describes Hainanese chicken rice as one of the "40 Singapore foods we can't live without". It also listed at number 45 on World's 50 most delicious foods compiled by CNN Go in 2011.In Malaysia, as in Singapore, chicken rice is available in many Chinese coffee shops, restaurants and street hawker stalls, and also in chain restaurants such as The Chicken Rice Shop and OldTown White Coffee.

                    <td>
                        Ingredients:<br>
1 whole chicken (3.5 lbs, 1.8kg), preferably organic,<br>
kosher salt,
4 section of fresh ginger, in 1/4 slices,<br>
2 stalks green onions, cut into 1" sections (both the green and white parts),
1 teaspoon sesame oil,<br>



FOR THE RICE:<br>
2 tablespoon chicken fat or 2 tbsp vegetable oil,
3 cloves garlic, finely minced,
1'' section of ginger, finely minced,
2 cups long-grain uncooked rice, washed and soaked in cool water for 10 min or longer,
2 cups reserved chicken poaching broth,
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil,,<br>
1 teaspoon kosher salt



FOR THE CHILI SAUCE:<br>
1 tablespoon lime juice,
2 tablespoon reserved chicken poaching broth,
2 teaspoon sugar,
4 tablespoon sriracha chili sauce,
4 cloves garlic,
1 ginger,
a generous pinch of salt, to taste,<br>



FOR THE TABLE:<br>
1/4 cup dark soy sauce,
Few sprigs cilantro,
1 cucumber, thinly sliced or cut into bite-sized chunks,

Directions:<br>
                        To clean the chicken, with a small handful of kosher salt, rub the chicken all over, getting rid of any loose skin and dirt. Rinse chicken well, inside and outside. Season generously with salt inside and outside. Stuff the chicken with the ginger slices and the green onion. Place the chicken in a large stockpot and fill with cold water to cover by 1 inch. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then immediately turn the heat to low to keep a simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes more (less if you're using a smaller chicken). Check for doneness by sticking a chopstick into the flesh under the leg and see if the juices run clear or insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh not touching bone. It should read 160F-165F.

 When the chicken is cooked through, turn off the heat and remove the pot from the burner. Immediately lift and transfer the chicken into a bath of ice water to cool and discard the ginger and green onion. Don't forget to reserve the poaching broth for your rice, your sauce, and the accompanying soup. The quick cooling will stop the cooking process, keeping the meat soft and tender, and giving the skin a lovely firm texture.

3. To cook the rice: Drain the rice. In a wok or sauce pan (use a medium sauce pan if you plan on cooking the rice on the stove top), heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil over medium-high heat. When hot, add the ginger and the garlic and fry until your kitchen smells like heaven. Be careful not to burn the aromatics! Add in your drained rice and stir to coat, cook for 2 minutes. Add the sesame oil, mix well.<br>

 While your rice is cooking, remove the chicken from the ice bath and rub the outside of the chicken with the sesame oil. Carve the chicken for serving.

 To make the chili sauce: Blend your chili sauce ingredients in a blender until smooth and bright red.

To make the soup: You should have six or seven cups of the reserved poaching broth left over to serve as soup. Just before serving, heat up the soup, taste and season with salt as necessary.

Serve the chicken rice with chili sauce, dark soy sauce, cucumber slices, and a bowl of hot broth garnished with cilantro or scallions
