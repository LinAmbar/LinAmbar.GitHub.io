             Ayam penyet (Javanese for: smashed fried chicken) is Indonesian — more precisely East Javanese cuisine — fried chicken dish consisting of fried chicken that is smashed with the pestle against mortar to make it softer, served with sambal, slices of cucumbers, fried tofu and tempeh. In Indonesia penyet dishes, such as fried chicken and ribs are commonly associated with Surabaya, the capital city of East Java. The most popular ayam penyet variant is ayam penyet Suroboyo.[1]

Today ayam penyet is commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Catherine Ling of CNN describes ayam penyet as one of the "40 Singapore foods we can't live without". [2] It has recently surged in popularity across Southeast Asia, where various chains of franchises has opened selling the dish along with other Indonesian delicacies.

It is also known for its spicy sambal, which is made with a mixture of chilli, anchovies, tomatoes, shallots, garlics, shrimp paste, tamarind and lime juice. Like its namesake, the mixture is then smashed into a paste to be eaten with the dish.
