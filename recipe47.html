                    Injera (Amharic: ənǧära እንጀራ [ɨndʒəra]; sometimes transliterated as enjera; or "taita" Tigrinya: ጣይታ) is an East African sourdough-risen flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. Traditionally made out of teff flour, it is a national dish in Ethiopia and Eritrea.<br>
                        Injera is usually made from the tiny, iron-rich teff. However, teff production is limited to certain middle elevations and regions with adequate rainfall, so it is relatively expensive for the average household. As many farmers in the Ethiopian highlands grow their own subsistence grains, wheat, barley, corn, and/or rice flour are sometimes used to replace some or all of the teff content. Teff flour is gluten free, therefore Injera that's made only with teff flour has higher demand. There are also different varieties of injera in Ethiopia, such as tekore (black), nech (white)[clarification needed], and sergegna (mixed).<br>
Batter is poured rapidly in a spiral from the outside inwards.
In making injera, teff flour is mixed with water and allowed to ferment for several days, as with sourdough starter. As a result of this process, injera has a mildly sour taste. The injera is then ready to be baked into large, flat pancakes. Unusual for a yeast or sourdough bread, the dough's viscosity allows it to be poured onto the baking surface, rather than rolled out.<br>
In terms of shape, injera compares to the French crêpe and the Indian dosa as a flatbread cooked in a circle and used as a base for other foods. The taste and texture, however, are unlike the crêpe and dosa, and more similar to the South Indian appam. The bottom surface of the injera, which touches the heating surface, will have a relatively smooth texture, while the top will become porous. This porous structure allows the injera to be a good bread to scoop up sauces and dishes.

                    <td>
                        Ingredient:<br>
.1/4 cup teff flour,<br>
• 3/4 cup all-purpose flour,<br> 
• 1 cup water,<br>
• a pinch of salt,<br>
• peanut or vegetable oil,<br>
• a mixing bowl,<br>
• a nonstick pan or cast-iron skillet,<br>
Tip:<br>
If you have teff grain instead of flour, first grind it in a clean coffee grinder, or with a mortar and pestle.<br>
 	 What Do I Do?<br>	
1. Put the teff flour in the bottom of a mixing bowl, and sift in the all-purpose flour.<br> 
2. Slowly add the water, stirring to avoid lumps.<br>
3. Put the batter aside for a day or more (up to three days) to allow it to ferment. In this time, your injera batter will start to bubble and acquire the slight tanginess for which it’s known. Note: If you find that your injera batter does not ferment on its own, try adding a teaspoon of yeast.<br>
4. Stir in the salt.<br>
5. Heat a nonstick pan or lightly oiled cast-iron skillet until a water 
drop dances on the surface. Make sure the surface of the pan is smooth: Otherwise, your injera might fall apart when you try to remove it.<br>
6. Coat the pan with a thin layer of batter. Injera should be thicker than a crêpe, but not as thick as a traditional pancake. It will rise slightly when it heats.<br>
7. Cook until holes appear on the surface of the bread. Once the surface is dry, remove the bread from the pan and let it cool.
