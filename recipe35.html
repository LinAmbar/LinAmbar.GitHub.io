                    Roti Jala (also known as Roti Kirai or Roti Renjis, or "lace pancake" in English), literally meaning "Net Bread", is a popular Malay tea time snack served with curry dishes which can be found in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The roti jala is a pretty dish that looks like a lace doily due to the way it is made. This is a very traditional Malay dish that is usually homemade and served at events such as weddings and festivals. It is usually eaten in sets of three to four pieces with curries, especially chicken curry, as a substitute to rice.Jalara Dosa originated from Roti jala.The Malays, being originally fishermen and living by the sea, find inspiration for the snack from the nets they used for fishing, thus the name. It is also called Roti Renjis, which means "Rinsed Bread", because of the original way it was made, which was by hand, in which the ingredient would be 'rinsed' onto the pan to be cooked. Roti Kirai is another name in which 'kirai' refers to the circular motion of the hand when pouring the ingredient from a condensed milk can with tiny holes poked through it.

                    <td>
                     Ingredients:<br>
1 cup all-purpose flour (150g),<br>
¼ tsp ground turmeric,<br>
¼ tsp salt,<br>
1 egg (beaten),<br>
¾ cup coconut milk mixed with ¾ cup (180ml) water,<br>
Vegetable oil to grease pan,<br>
Step:
Sift flour and ground turmeric into a large bowl. Add salt. Stir in beaten egg and coconut milk until a smooth batter forms.<br>
Strain batter to remove any lumps.<br>
Brush a little oil onto a non-stick pan on medium heat. Pour a little batter into the roti jala cup until about half full. Move the cup in a circular motion over the pan to form a lacy pattern. Cook until set.<br> This only takes about 2 minutes. Slide crepe out of pan onto a plate. Repeat until all batter is used up.
When cool enough to handle, fold in both sides of the crepe and roll to form a neat package.<br>
Serve with your favorite curry.
