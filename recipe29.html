                        Fish and chips is a hot dish of English origin consisting of fried battered fish and hot chips. It is a common take-away food and an early example of culinary fusion.First appearing in the 1860s, in 1910 there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the UK, and by the 1930s it increased to over 35,000.

                    <td>
                         Ingredients:<br>
4 cod fish fillets or 4 haddock fillets,<br>
6 ounces plain flour,<br>
1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda,<br>
1 (8 fluid ounce) bottlebritish beer,<br>
Small 1⁄2 lemon, juice of,<br>
salt & pepper,<br>
extra flour,<br>
3 lbs potatoes, peeled & chipped,<br>
good quality cooking fat or oil,<br>
Step:
1.Heat fat up in a chip pan or automatic deep fat fryer - mine has a chip setting which is 190°C.
Peel the potatoes and cut into chunky sized chips. Rinse and dry thoroughly.<br>
2.Fry chips for about 3 minutes until soft but NOT coloured. Drain and shake well and set to one side.<br>
3.Put some flour onto a plate. Dredge the fish fillets in the flour thoroughly - this is VERY important, it stops the batter sliding off when fried! Leave the fish fillets in the flour whilst you make the batter.
Some people say you should make the batter at least one hour before - I have found little difference - so make it before if it is convenient or now!<br>
4.Put flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt and pepper into a large roomy bowl. Add the beer gradually, stop when you have a thick coating type of batter. Drink any beer that is left! Whisk thoroughly until it is smooth and there are no lumps.Add the lemon juice OR a splash of malt vinegar if desired. Mix thoroughly again.<br>
5.Adjust deep fat fryer to fish frying temperature of 160°C.
Take one fillet of fish at a time and holding it by the tail or thin end (!) swirl it around the batter until well coated - plunge into hot fat immediately. As soon as it has crisped up and set, add your other fillets one at a time, taking out the first ones as they cook - about 6 to 10 minutes depending on the thickness. Place onto a tray and keep warm in the oven.
Turn up the heat setting to 190°C again and cook your chips until golden and crisp.
Serve on plates or newspaper with salt & vinegar!
