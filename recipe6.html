                        Shabu-shabu (しゃぶしゃぶ? , also spelled syabu-syabu) is a Japanese nabemono hotpot dish of thinly sliced meat and vegetables boiled in water. The term is onomatopoeia, derived from the sound emitted when the ingredients are stirred in the cooking pot and served with dipping sauces.[citation needed] The food is cooked piece by piece by the diner at the table. Shabu-shabu is considered to be more savory and less sweet than sukiyaki.<br>
                        
                        Shabu-Shabu was introduced in Japan in the 20th century[citation needed] with the opening of the restaurant "Suehiro" in Osaka, where the name was invented. Its origins are traced back to the Chinese hot pot known as instant-boiled mutton (Shuàn Yángròu). Shabu-Shabu is most similar to the original Chinese version when compared to other Japanese dishes (nabemono) such as sukiyaki.[citation needed] Suehiro registered the name as a trademark in 1955. Together with sukiyaki, Shabu-Shabu is a common dish in tourist hot-spots, especially in Tokyo, but also in local Japanese neighborhoods (colloquially called "Little Tokyos") in countries such as the United States and Canada.</td>
