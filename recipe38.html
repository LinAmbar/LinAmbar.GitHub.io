                    Thai fried bananas (กล้วยทอด, kluay thot).Thai-styled fried bananas are more commonly called kluay khaek (กล้วยแขก), a possible hint of its South Asian influence (Indian banana fritter/pakora?). The word, “khaek,” is used for the most part in a neutral manner to refer to persons of South Asian or Middle Eastern origin (or sometimes Southeast Asians of the Islamic faith), but it is perceived by some to be a racially-prejudiced term. 
                      Pisang goreng (fried banana in Indonesian/Malay) is a snack food made of banana or plantain, covered in batter or not, being deep fried in hot cooking oil, mostly found throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Brunei and the Philippines.

It is consumed as a snack in the morning and afternoon. In Indonesia and Malaysia, pisang goreng is often sold by street vendors, although some sellers have a storefront from which to sell their wares. In the Philippines, it is called by different names as it has different variations. It is called "maruya" if coated in batter prior to frying, pritong saging for those that are simply fried in oil, or "banana cue" or "toron" for those that are fried in oil and sugar before sticking into wooden skewers. These are often served as mid-afternoon snacks.

The banana is battered and then deep fried. Most street vendors will then sell it as is. Restaurants that serve pisang goreng are more sophisticated and present it in various ways, such as with cheese, jam, condensed milk, or chocolate.

In Suriname this snack is also known as bakabana (meaning baked banana in Surinamese).

Plantain is often used instead of banana. Pisang raja is a popular kind of banana used for pisang goreng.

Ingredient:<br>
One pound of peeled bananas,<br>
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons rice flour (or 50% rice flour and 50% all-purpose flour for heartier crust),<br>
1/2 cup sugar,<br>
1/2 cup unsweetened dried coconut (or fresh very finely-grated coconut or frozen grated coconut, thawed),<br>
3/4 cup clear limestone solution or 3/4 cup water with 1.5 teaspoons baking soda mixed in,<br>
1.5 teaspoons salt,<br>
1 tablespoon of untoasted white sesame seeds,<br>
About 4 cups of mild vegetable oil for frying,<br>
Step:<br>
Slice the bananas lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices; set aside.<br>
Whisk together the rest of the ingredients, except the oil.<br>
In a medium frying pan or heavy-bottomed pot, heat up the oil to about 350° F. Keep the temperature steady.<br>
Put the banana slices into the batter. Pick up one slice at a time, making sure it’s thoroughly coated with the batter, and carefully lower it into the hot oil. Don’t fry too many slices of banana at the same time as it will cause the oil temperature to drop too low resulting in soggy, oily fried bananas.<br>
Flip the banana pieces as necessary to achieve even browning.<br>
Once the banana slices are golden brown, remove them to a plate lined with a piece of paper towel.<br>
Serve immediately.<br>
