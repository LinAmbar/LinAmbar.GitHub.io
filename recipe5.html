                        <img src="images/japanese%20curry%20rice.jpg" style="width:450px;height:350px"/>Curry (カレー? karē) is one of the most popular dishes in Japan. It is commonly served in three main forms: curry rice (カレーライス? karē raisu, curry over rice), curry udon (curry over noodles), and curry bread (a curry-filled pastry). Curry rice is most commonly referred to simply as "curry" (カレー? karē).<br>

A wide variety of vegetables and meats are used to make Japanese curry. The basic vegetables are onions, carrots, and potatoes. For the meat, beef, pork, and chicken are the most popular. Katsu-karē is a breaded deep-fried cutlet (usually pork or chicken) with curry sauce.<br>

Curry was introduced to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912) by the British, at a time when India was under the colonial rule of the British Raj. The dish became popular and available for purchase in supermarkets and restaurants in the late 1960s. It has been adapted since its introduction to Japan, and is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish.

                        INGREDIENTS:<br>
For the roux:<br>
3 tablespoons butter,<br>
1/4 cup flour,<br>
2 tablespoons garam masala (or curry powder),<br>
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (add less if you want it mild or more if you want it spicy),<br>
Fresh ground black pepper,<br>
1 tablespoons ketchup (or tomato paste),<br>
1 tablespoons tonkatsu sauce (or Worcestershire sauce),<br>
For the curry;<br>
2 teaspoon oil,<br>
2 large onions sliced thin<br>
2 pounds chicken thighs cleaned and cut into chunks (you could also use beef, shrimp, or tofu),<br>
2 carrots cut into chunks,<br>
4 cups water,<br>
2 large yukon gold potatoes cut into large chunks,<br>
1 small apple peeled cored and pureed (I use a Microplane),<br>
2 teaspoons kosher salt (use less if you use regular salt),<br>
1 teaspoon garam masala,<br>
1/2 cup peas,<br>
DIRECTIONS:<br>
1.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium low heat and add the onions. Sauté the onions until they are golden brown and caramelized (about 30 minutes). Turn up the heat to high, add the chicken, and brown.<br>

2.
Add the carrots and the water, then bring to a boil. Skim off any foam or oil that accumulates at the surface then lower heat to medium and add the potatoes, puréed apple, salt, and garam masala. Simmer for about 30 minutes or until you can pass a fork through the carrots and potatoes and the meat is tender.<br>

3.
For the roux, melt the butter over medium low heat. Add the flour and garam masala, stirring until you have a thick paste. Add the cayenne pepper and some fresh ground black pepper and incorporate into the roux. Add the ketchup and tonkatsu sauce and combine. Continue to cook until the paste starts crumbling. Remove from heat and set aside until the meat and veggies are ready.<br>

4.
To make the curry, just ladle about 2 cups of liquid into the roux then whisk until it's smooth. Pour this mixture back into the other pot and gently stir until thickened. Add the peas and heat through.<br>

5.
Serve over rice or noodles.
