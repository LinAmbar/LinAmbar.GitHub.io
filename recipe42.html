                    Gelato (Italian pronunciation: [dʒeˈlaːto]; plural: gelati [dʒeˈlaːti], from the Italian word gelato meaning "frozen"is an English term for ice cream made in an Italian style. Gelato is made with a base of milk, cream, and sugar, and flavored with fruit and nut purees and other flavourings. It is generally lower in fat, but higher in sugar, than other styles of ice cream. Gelato typically contains less air and more flavoring than other kinds of frozen desserts, giving it a density and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.<br>

In Italy, by law, gelato must have at least 3.5% butterfat.[citation needed] In the United States, there is no legal standard of definition for gelato as there is for ice cream, which must contain at least 10% butterfat.Gelato can be served in any way that ice cream is, including cup, cone, sandwich, cake, pie, or on a stick.

                      Ingredients:<br>
2 cups milk,<br>
1 cup heavy cream ,<br>
4 egg yolks ,<br>
1/2 cup sugar,<br> 
                        Step:<br>
In a medium saucepan, mix milk and cream. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.<br>
In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar until frothy. Gradually pour the warm milk into the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.<br>
Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for several hours or overnight.<br>
Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm. If the gelato is too firm, place it in the refrigerator until it reaches the desired consistency
