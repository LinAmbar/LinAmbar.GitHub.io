                        Sukiyaki (鋤焼?, or more commonly すき焼き) is a Japanese dish that is prepared and served in the nabemono (Japanese hot pot) style.It consists of meat (usually thinly sliced beef) which is slowly cooked or simmered at the table, alongside vegetables and other ingredients, in a shallow iron pot in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. The ingredients are usually dipped in a small bowl of raw, beaten eggs after being cooked in the pot, and then eaten.Generally sukiyaki is a winter dish and it is commonly found at bōnenkai, Japanese year-end parties.

                    <td>Ingredients:<br>
1-2 packages udon,<br>
½ head napa cabbage (½ head = about 10 leaves =1.8 oz or 690 g),<br>
½ bunch shungiku (Tong Hao or Garland Chrysanthemum) (½ bunch = 7 oz or 200 g),<br>
1 Tokyo negi (or negi, long onion),<br>
1 package enoki mushrooms,<br>
8 shiitake mushrooms (carve decorative shapes),<br>
1 package Yaki Tofu (Broiled Tofu) (1 package = 9 oz or 255 g),<br>
⅓ carrot (for decoration, optional),<br>
1 package shirataki noodles (or cellophane noodles, yam noodles) (1 package = 7 oz or 198 g),<br>
1 Tbsp neutral flavor oil (vegetable, canola, etc),<br>
1 lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or rib eye) (1 lb = 454 g) (or slice your own meat,),<br>
1 Tbsp brown sugar,<br>
1-1.5 cup dashi (to dilute the sauce) (or water),
Sukiyaki Sauce (Yield 2 ⅔ cup),<br>
1 cup sake (1 cup = 240 ml),
1 cup mirin (1 cup = 240 ml),<br>
¼ cup granulated sugar (¼ cup = 60 ml),
1 cup soy sauce (1 cup = 240 ml),<br>

    Instructions:<br>,
Gather all the ingredients.
Sukiyaki Ingredients,<br>
Combine 1 cup sake, 1 cup mirin, ¼ cup sugar, and 1 cup soy sauce in a small sauce pan and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and set aside. If your udon is frozen, cook it in boiling water until loosen. Remove from heat and soak in iced water to prevent overcooking them. Drain and transfer to a plate. Prepare sukiyaki ingredients. Cut napa cabbage into 2” (5 cm) wide then cut in half right at the middle of the white part.Cut shungiku into 2” (5 cm) wide, and slice Tokyo negi. Discard the bottom part of enoki and tear into smaller bundles.<br>
Discard the shiitake stem and decorate the top of shiitake if you like.
Cut tofu into smaller pieces (I usually cut into 6-8 pieces).
If you like, you can slice some carrots and then stamp them into a floral shape for decoration.
Drain and rinse the shirataki noodles (sorry no photo). Put all the ingredients on one big platter for the table or into smaller individual servings.
Set a portable gas cook top at the dining table and heat a cast iron sukiyaki pot (or any pot) on medium heat. When it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp. cooking oil.<br>
Place some of sliced beef to sear and sprinkle 1 Tbsp. brown sugar. Flip and cook the meat. You can pour a little bit of Sukiyaki Sauce over the meat and enjoy the sweet and nicely caramelized meat now, or continue to next step and eat it later.
Pour 1 ⅓ cup of Sukiyaki Sauce and 1 cup dashi (or water) in the pot, or until ⅔ of the ingredients are submerged in the sauce.
Place some of the ingredients in the pot (except for udon). Put the lid on and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat and simmer until the ingredients are cooked through. Once the food is cooked, you can start enjoying them. Keep adding more ingredients and sauce as you eat from the pot. If the sauce is too salty, add dashi to dilute. If the vegetables diluted the sauce too much, then add more sukiyaki sauce.
We usually end the sukiyaki meal with udon. When most of the ingredients have disappeared, add udon to the pot. Cook until heated through and enjoy.
