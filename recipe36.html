                    A beef tenderloin, known as an eye fillet in Australasia, filet in France, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Germany, is cut from the loin of beef.As with all quadrupeds, the tenderloin refers to the psoas major muscle ventral to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, near the kidneys.The tenderloin is an oblong shape spanning two primal cuts: the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries) and the sirloin (called the rump in Commonwealth countries).The tenderloin sits beneath the ribs, next to the backbone. It has two ends: the butt and the "tail". The smaller, pointed end—the "tail"—starts a little past the ribs, growing in thickness until it ends in the "sirloin" primal cut, which is closer to the butt of the cow. This muscle does very little work, so it is the most tender part of the beef.

                    <td>
                       Ingredients:<br>
1 whole beef tenderloin, trimmed of all visible fat,<br>
Kosher salt,<br>
2 teaspoons sugar,<br>
1/2 cup tri-color peppercorns, crushed with a rolling pin,<br>
1 stick butter,<br>
2 cloves garlic, crushed,<br>
Step:<br>
Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.<br>
Place the tenderloin on a roasting rack. Sprinkle generously with kosher salt and sugar, which will deepen the savory flavors.<br>
Press the crushed peppercorns all over the surface of the meat. Insert a meat thermometer and place in the oven until the beef registers 120 to 125 degrees F for medium-rare/rare. Beef will probably cook in 20 to 25 minutes depending on its temp before it goes in the oven.<br>
While the meat is roasting, melt the butter with the garlic in a small skillet, and allow the butter to slightly brown. Remove the garlic and discard.<br>
Remove the meat when it's done and pour the garlic butter over gently (it should sizzle when it hits the meat). Cover the meat loosely with foil and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.<br>
